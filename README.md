### Adjusting Wavelengths in the Rotated Rainbow:

By adjusting the wavelengths of lights in the rotated rainbow experiment, you can observe changes in color perception. Different wavelengths correspond to different colors in the visible spectrum. Red light typically has longer wavelengths, while blue light has shorter wavelengths.

### Adjusting Parameters of the Stockman and Sharpe Model:

The Stockman and Sharpe model is widely used to characterize human color perception. It is based on the sensitivity of three types of cone cells in the retina: short-wavelength (S-cones), medium-wavelength (M-cones), and long-wavelength (L-cones). These cones respond differently to various wavelengths of light.

By adjusting the parameters of this model, such as the spectral sensitivity curves of the cones or the weighting factors applied to different wavelengths, you can simulate different color vision deficiencies (e.g., protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia). This analysis can provide insights into how individuals with color vision deficiencies perceive colors differently from those with normal color vision.

### Adjusting Parameters of the Camera Projection Model:
The camera projection model describes how light entering the camera lens is translated into an image. Adjusting parameters such as exposure settings (e.g., aperture, shutter speed, ISO), white balance, and color profile can significantly impact the resulting image.

By analyzing differences in results based on adjustments to these parameters, you can understand how they affect color accuracy, contrast, and overall image quality. This analysis is essential for photographers, videographers, and imaging professionals to produce desired visual outcomes and ensure consistency across different imaging devices.
